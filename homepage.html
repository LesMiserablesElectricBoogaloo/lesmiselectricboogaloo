                    <p>157 years ago, Victor Hugo released Les Miserables to the thunderous applause of French society.
                        Today, we release Les Miserables Version 2.0: The Electric Boogaloo to the world. Aimed at
                        modernising the meaning of Les Miserables, this album contains a variety of music, ranging from
                        rock to pop, all related to thematic point of Les Miserables. Specifically, this album is
                        centred around the thematic idea of the strength of relationships between people. Be it romantic
                        love, familial love, or even just friendship, human bonding has the power to break social and
                        economic restraints, to create happiness, and to ultimately redeem people. Kick back, relax, and
                        enjoy!</p>
                </div>
                <div id="conclusionDiv">
                    <p>The ultimate goal of this album is to show the universal power of human bonding. A major French
                        novel 157 years ago and popular American music from the modern day may not have much in common,
                        but they both show how human bonding can break restraints and redeem people. The ability to bond
                        with others is a uniquely (and powerful) part of being human. It is a, “...grand thing... to be
                        loved! What a far grander thing it is to love” (365)!</p>

                    <p class="linerNotes">In the beginning of Fantine, when Jean Valjean reaches the little town of
                        D----, Hugo uses diction to introduce the reader to a sorrowful world. He traverses throughout
                        the street “at random”, “sad” and “humiliated”, followed by the townspeople's stares of “fear”
                        and “distrust”. The “night”, with the “cold Alpine winds” howling in the background, is full
                        “low clouds” (10-11). This mirrors the starting section of “We’re Finally Landing Home”. It
                        consists of a slow tempo and moderately high pitches, which culminates into an overall sad tone.
                        However, as the music progresses, a positive counter-melody slowly begins to develop. More
                        positive diction is introduced as well. When Bienvenu opens the door to let Valjean in,
                        Valjean’s face is described to have instantly lit up by the “fire”. As they feast inside on, “a
                        soup, a few figs, green cheese”, the light of “two silver candlesticks” fill up the room
                        (17-18). The shift in diction and tone from sadness into happiness emphasises the power of the
                        priest’s generosity and respect towards Valjean. The bonds between people are ultimately based
                        off such feelings.</p>

                    <p class="linerNotes">
                        Throughout most of this section, Hugo uses diction to create a sad tone around Fantine. Similar
                        to the section, Inkwell Hell maintains a heavy and dreary tone. The song achieves this through,
                        having a slow feeling pace. One note breaks-per bar in the drum beat slows the feel of the song.
                        The song only has a few instruments which helps maintain a dreary tone. In the beginning of the
                        text, Fantine is a “pretty blonde” with “gold” on “her head” and “pearls in her mouth” (42).
                        Fantine’s situation degrades into poverty and desperation as she sells some of her teeth for
                        medicine for her child, leaving “blood stains” and a “dark cavity” (66) in her mouth. She
                        develops “a slight dry cough” and her arms becomes “hot” (64). She, “has nothing left of what
                        she had been” (67). Despite this degradation, Fantine still loves her child dearly. The final
                        description of Fantine is a contrast to her usual descriptions. Right before her death, when
                        Fantine thought she would see Cosette, she “beamed with joy” and ”light up her whole
                        countenance” (125). This is similar to the contrast in Inkwell Hell, in which a fluid solo
                        develops, contrasting the repeated monotone background chords. This contrast in the tone
                        surrounding Fantine shows the power of love. Fantine’s love for her child is very powerful,
                        almost more powerful than reality. Love is a powerful feeling.</p>

                        Wild, wild horses we'll ride them some day<br>
                        Wild horses couldn't drag me away<br>
                        Wild, wild horses we'll ride them some day
                    </p>
                    <p class="linerNotes">In the section <i>Cosette</i>, we learn that Valjean has taken it upon himself
                        to take care of Cosette herself. As soon as she is removed and given a chance to play she is
                        “inexpressibly happy with her doll and good friend” (182). This is similar to how the singer is
                        described as he states that “Childhood living is easy to do. The things you wanted I bought them
                        for you” tying back to when Valjean got Cosette a doll for herself. The speaker nostalgically
                        looks back at his experience raising a child, and similarly to Valjean, appears to be thinking
                        of this experience as if it were his own childhood. Valjean’s perspective of love changed from
                        when he first saved her and when he brought her to the Gorbeau house. He admits that he was
                        “cross, sullen, abstinent, ignorant, and intractable”. Yet when he saw Cosette, he felt that
                        “his heart moved” (183). The singer also experienced something similar, and focuses all his
                        effort into caring for his child, claiming that “Wild horses couldn’t drag me away” from her.
                        Valjean’s love for Cosette serves as a powerful redemptive force. As he cares for her he is able
                        to shed his life in the galleys and be happy. Hugo wrote “all that had occurred in his
                        existence, for the last six months, led him back toward the holy injunctions of the bishop,
                        Cosette through love” (216). Cosette’s love helped Valjean learn to love again as well as allow
                        him to redeem himself through fulfilling Fantine’s wish and becoming a father.</p>

                        <br>How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore<br>
                        And a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot<br>
                        In the Caribbean by providence impoverished<br>
                        In squalor, grow up to be a hero and a scholar?<br><br>
                        The ten-dollar founding father without a father<br>
                        Got a lot farther by working a lot harder<br>
                        By being a lot smarter By being a self-starter<br>
                        By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter<br><br>
                        And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted away<br>
                        Across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up<br>
                        Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of<br>
                        The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter<br><br>
                        Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned<br>
                        Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain<br>
                        Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain<br>
                        And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain<br><br>
                        Well, the word got around, they said, this kid is insane, man<br>
                        Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland<br>

                    <p class="linerNotes">
                        Although society is extremely harsh, it can have moments of kindness towards an individual. Jean
                        Valjean, a convict condemned to life imprisonment, saves a man stuck on a ship mask. The crowd
                        that gathered around, “cried… hugged each other on the wharves… voices were heard exclaiming
                        ‘This man must be pardoned’” (146). Alexander Hamilton grew up as an outcast in Caribbean
                        society, because he was, “... a bastard, orphan, son of a whore“. However, by reading and
                        working extremely hard, he became wealthy in knowledge. The people on his island noticed that he
                        was, “... insane, man. / Took up a collection and sent him to the mainland. / ‘Get your
                        education. Don’t forget where you came from’”. Society’s harshness is the primary focus of both
                        pieces of media. However, society does express moments of kindness and mercy towards Valjean and
                        Hamilton, almost like a redemption for its previous cruelness. Although society can lean towards
                        evilness, it is not inherently evil. A society can be redeemed through its bonds to an
                        individual.</p>

                    <p class="linerNotes">The idea of <i>Let Her Go</i> by Passenger matches the idea of submission that
                        comes from multiple relationships formed between characters in Les Miserables, specifically
                        between Monsieur Gillenormand and Marius and between Jean Valjean and Cosette.<br><br>
                        Gillenormand and Valjean have similar roles to Marius and Cosette; they are both overprotective
                        and dominating over their children. In the song, the line, “…never to touch and never to keep
                        ‘cause you loved her too much and you dive too deep” parallels the story, in which both
                        Gillenormand and Valjean, as the song puts it, “dived too deep” with their relationship with
                        their children, dictating their children for their own benefit. In attempt to keep his love and
                        obedience, Gillenormand prevents Marius from ever finding out about his dad and tries to dictate
                        his political views while similarily Valjean tries to close off Cosette from society, mostly in
                        an attempt to prevent her from leaving him to be with someone else.<br><br>
                        However, both Monsieur Gillenormand and Jean Valjean eventually “let them go”, as the song says
                        multiple times, and allow them to be free and happy by themselves. This submission is depicted
                        in the song in the final lyric, which is sung in a defeated tone, “and you let her go”. This
                        action of letting go of their beloved children characterises them as good fathers who put their
                        children’s happiness before their own. Ultimately, both the song and the book represent the idea
                        of submission and letting go in a relationship in order to allow for more freedom (and thus
                        happiness) for the people involved.

                        <br>There's 104 days of summer vacation<br>
                        And school comes along just to end it<br>
                        So the annual problem for our generation<br>
                        Is finding a good way to spend it<br><br>
                        Like maybe...<br>
                        Building a rocket<br>
                        Or fighting a mummy<br>
                        Or climbing up the Eiffel Tower<br><br>
                        Discovering something that doesn't exist (Hey! )<br>
                        Or giving a monkey a shower<br><br>
                        Surfing tidal waves<br>
                        Creating nanobots<br>
                        Or locating Frankenstein's brain (It's over here! )<br><br>
                        Finding a dodo bird<br>
                        Painting a continent<br>
                        Or driving your sister insane (Phineas! )<br><br>
                        As you can see<br>
                        There's a whole lot of stuff to do<br>
                        Before school starts this fall (Come on Perry)<br><br>
                        So stick with us 'cause Phineas and Ferb<br>
                        Are gonna do it all<br>
                        So stick with us 'cause Phineas and Ferb are<br>
                        Gonna do it all!<br>
                        (Mom! Phineas and Ferb are making a title sequence! )<br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="linerNotes">The ideas of liberty are exemplified through characterisation throughout the
                        book. Éponine tells Marius, the love of her life, that his friends are starting a revolution at
                        a barricade, and Marius leaves to go join them. Later, when the members of the Friends of ABC
                        start to go to the barricades, Éponine asks Courfeyrac for, “‘Monsieur Marius, if you please.’
                        ‘He is not in. As for myself, I shall not be in. I am going to the barricades.’ ‘Do you want me
                        to go with you?’ ‘As you wish. The road is free and the street belongs to everyone.’ He had
                        perceived the young man had in fact followed him” (416). In order to be with Marius, Éponine
                        takes matters in her own hands. This and the dialogue characterises Éponine as a “free-willed”
                        soul. This is especially evident with her walking on the road, which is symbolic of freedom.
                        Ultimately, this leads to Éponine’s redemption, which is dying at the barricades by taking a
                        bullet for Marius. For Phineas and Ferb, a problem they have is finding a, “...good way to spend
                        [summer]. / Like maybe / Building a rocket or fighting a mummy / Discovering something that
                        doesn’t exist…” Due to the fact that school is no longer a restriction on them, Phineas and Ferb
                        can spend their time exploring their freedom, which characterises them as free-willed. For
                        Phineas, Ferb, and Éponine, their free spirited nature allows them to explore their bonds with
                        other people. For Éponine, it is her love for Marius, and for Phineas, it is his brotherly love
                        for Ferb.</p>

                        <br>I'd like to be under the sea<br>
                        In an octopus' garden in the shade<br>
                        He'd let us in, knows where we've been<br>
                        In his octopus' garden in the shade<br><br>
                        I'd ask my friends to come and see<br>
                        An octopus' garden with me<br>
                        I'd like to be under the sea<br>
                        In an octopus' garden in the shade.<br><br>
                        We would be warm below the storm<br>
                        In our little hideaway beneath the waves<br>
                        Resting our head on the sea bed<br>
                        In an octopus' garden near a cave<br><br>
                        We would sing and dance around<br>
                        Because we know we can't be found<br>
                        I'd like to be under the sea<br>
                        In an octopus' garden in the shade<br><br>
                        We would shout and swim about<br>
                        The coral that lies beneath the waves<br>
                        (Lies beneath the ocean waves)<br>
                        Oh what joy for every girl and boy<br>
                        Knowing they're happy and they're safe<br>
                        (Happy and they're safe)<br><br>
                        We would be so happy you and me<br>
                        No one there to tell us what to do<br>
                        I'd like to be under the sea<br>
                        In an octopus' garden with you.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="linerNotes">The motif of garden is used throughout the book as a symbol for the human
                        soul, although the exact aspect of the soul the garden represents depends on the character
                        present in the garden. For Cosette and Marius, the garden represents the the soul’s ability to
                        bond with others. Marius tries to be with Cosette, but he fears being seen by Jean. However,
                        they finally meet alone in her garden. There, Cosette embraces Marius with, “...one kiss. They
                        looked at each other with brilliant eyes. These two beings, pure as spirits, told each other all
                        of their dreams… They have confided to each other in an intimacy of the ideal…” (369-370).
                        Ringo, from the Beatles, similarly wants to bond with his friends, “...In an octopus’ garden
                        near the sea. / We would sing and dance around / Because we know we can’t be found.” The privacy
                        of the garden shields them away from others, which is symbolic of the idea of society and
                        intimacy. It is hard to intimately bond with others because of societal pressures, and for
                        Marius specifically, his main pressure is Jean.</p>

                        She's been living in her uptown world<br>
                        I bet she's never had a backstreet guy<br>
                        I bet her mama never told her why<br><br>
                        I'm gonna try for an uptown girl<br>
                        She's been living in her white bread world<br>
                        As long as anyone with hot blood can<br>

                        You know I can't afford to buy her pearls<br>
                        But maybe someday when my ship comes in<br>
                        She'll understand what kind of guy I've been<br>

                    <p class="linerNotes">Throughout the passage, the motif of class differences in relationships plays
                        a key role in developing the idea that relationships between people should be beyond just social
                        status. Monsieur Madeleine, a mayor, dedicated himself to Fantine, a lowly prostitute. Bishop
                        Myriel protected and guided Jean, an ex-convict. Marius, a man from a wealthy family, wishes to
                        marry Cosette, the “daughter” of a lower class man. His grandfather questions if, “‘...the girl
                        is rich? No dowry?’ ‘No.’ ‘Pttt.’ ‘Allow me to marry her.’ ‘Never’” (394-395). Billy Joel, a
                        working class man, also wishes to be with someone of a different class. Specifically, he wants
                        to be with an, “Uptown girl. / I’ve bet she’s never been with a backstreet boy. / I bet her
                        mamma never told her why. / I’m in love with an upstreet girl.” The social connotations of
                        having a relationship between a rich person and a poor person are immense. Marius’ grandfather’s
                        scoffs at the idea. Joel states that such a relationship is pretty rare, so it is implied that
                        there are many social barriers. However, relationships are not all about social class.
                        Relationships should exist because of the feelings between two people.</p>

                        I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit<br>

                        Don't look back<br>
                        Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check<br><br>
                        I don't ever want to let you down<br>

                    <p class="linerNotes">The song <i>Its Time</i> begins with a character giving up on his good school
                        life, saying “I get a little bit bigger but then I’ll admit, I’m just the same as I was”. He was
                        “spent” and feels like “…giving the academy a raining check”, which means he wants to leave. He
                        seems to realize that “...after all, this city never sleeps at night” and that everybody spends
                        too much studying. If he drops out, he realises his life would be that “this road never looked
                        so lonely”, and that everything he worked for would ultimately lead to unhappiness, he also says
                        multiple times, “I’m never changing who I am”, showing that he does not have the courage to
                        change who he is despite the situation. This is partly due to the fact that he “…don’t ever want
                        to let you [the singer’s parents] down”.<br><br>
                        After Javert is spared by Jean Valjean, he struggles between the fact that there is something
                        above love, specifically the mercy and love Jean gives him, and the supreme authority of the
                        law. He felt, “…that duty was growing weaker in his conscience” (530). Javert seems to question
                        if, similar to the character in the song, that he will ever be able to change, as his primary
                        fear is the two roads, “…before him… he saw two, and that terrified him” (530). This is symbolic
                        of Javert’s dilemma. After much self-reflection, he accepts that “...there is then something
                        more than duty” (531). Rather than changing his ways, Javert choose death. He rejects change,
                        but because he realises his previous beliefs could not hold, he had to die.<br><br>
                        The similar struggles felt by both Javert and the character in <i>Its Time</i> comes together to
                        emphasize this rejection of change. Both show the power of relationships. For the character in
                        Its Time, the power of his bonds to his parents makes him choose to stay in college, perhaps for
                        the better as he avoided the “lonely” road. Although the love and mercy Jean shows to Javert
                        ended in Javert rejecting this possibility of change, this still had a drastic effect on Javert,
                        who spent his entire life living under his devout law. The power of love and human contact can
                        move someone seemingly lacking emotion for their entire lives, to consider a new approach, and
                        although this approach was death, it was a new approach nonetheless.

                        <br>I used to rule the world<br>
                        Seas would rise when I gave the word<br>
                        Now in the morning, I sleep alone<br>
                        Sweep the streets I used to own<br><br>
                        I used to roll the dice<br>

                        One minute I held the key<br>
                        Next the walls were closed on me<br>
                        And I discovered that my castles stand<br>

                    <p class="linerNotes"><i>Viva La Vida</i> by Coldplay tells a very similar story to that of Jean
                        Valjean’s
                        path taken throughout the entirety of <i>Les Miserables.</i> The song’s lyrics begin with a
                        character seeming to retell his life story to Jesus, starting at the moment in which he was
                        anointed “king”. As the story progresses, the character seems to discover more and more of the
                        evil and sin of having authority, starting at the quote “I discovered that my castles stand upon
                        pillars of salt, pillars of sand”. The reference to salt and sand is a biblical allusion to the
                        idea that one’s basis for a kingdom is sinful and foolish. Salt represents standing on one’s
                        past and sand represents standing on a false lifestyle. The character seems to have resolute
                        acceptance of this sin when he realizes he’s “just a puppet on a lonely string… who would ever
                        want to be king?” and accepts the fact that when he “ruled the world”, God was condemning him.
                        The song concludes with, “Saint Peter won’t call my name… but that was when I ruled the world,”
                        using the word “but” to show that he accepted that he was in sin when he ruled the world, but he
                        is not king anymore, so he cannot just ignore such things.<br><br>
                        This account is very similar to the story of Jean Valjean in <i>Les Miserables</i>. Valjean,
                        much like
                        the character of <i>Viva La Vida</i>, felt as if he “ruled the world” at times, and throughout
                        his
                        experience as “king”, or in his case, a rich mayor of a small town, he was always in fear of
                        returning to his sinful self prior to being mayor. He always wanted to keep his castles from
                        standing on pillars of salt or sand, that is, standing on his past (the salt), or of a false
                        lifestyle (the sand). His primary motivation was “…to close the door on his past” (89), showing
                        a similar fear of their past selves shared between Jean Valjean and the character in the song.
                        Both Jean Valjean and the one in Viva La Vida end their journeys never directly claiming to have
                        been redeemed from their fear of themselves and their past evil. However, both realise their
                        past errors and have changed. For Jean Valjean, Hugo writes that “the light from the
                        candlesticks fell upon him… some mighty angel was standing... awaiting his soul” (594), in order
                        to show that he was ultimately forgiven, since the candlesticks were originally used to
                        represent the saving of Jean Valjean by the Bishop. Meanwhile, in Viva La Vida, the character
                        asks Jesus to “Be my mirror, sword and shield”, which alludes to another instance in the Bible
                        (Ephesians 6:10-18), which ultimately refers to these defensive tools as the word of God,
                        protecting one from the evil of the world, especially the sin coming from temporal
                        reign.<br><br>

                        This use of similar symbolism and allusions ultimately ties together the song <i>Viva La
                            Vida</i> and the character Jean Valjean.
